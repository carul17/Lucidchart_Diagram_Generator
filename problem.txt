Problem Statement: University Course Registration System
A university needs a Course Registration System to manage students, faculty, and course enrollment.

Students must be able to register for courses, view their enrollment status, and drop courses if needed.
Faculty members are responsible for teaching courses, viewing enrolled students, and assigning grades.
The system should ensure that students meet prerequisites before enrolling in a course.
A course catalog should be maintained, listing available courses, faculty assignments, and schedules.
The Registrarâ€™s Office must be able to generate reports on student enrollment, faculty workload, and course availability.
